StellarVeriphy is a decentralized digital content verification and provenance platform built on the **Stellar blockchain**. It enables creators, developers, and platforms to generate immutable authenticity proofs for digital media directly on-chain using **Soroban smart contracts** — Stellar's native smart contract platform built on Rust/WASM.

By leveraging Stellar's ultra-low transaction fees (~0.00001 XLM), fast 3–5 second finality, and energy-efficient **Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP)**, StellarVeriphy makes large-scale content verification affordable, scalable, and environmentally sustainable.

## 🌐 What StellarVeriphy Solves

Digital media today can easily be manipulated, forged, or misrepresented — deepfakes, AI-generated content, tampered documents. StellarVeriphy provides a robust solution through:

- **Tamper-proof content provenance** — records the history and origin of content immutably on Stellar.
- **Cryptographic authenticity verification** — uses advanced cryptographic techniques to verify media has not been altered.
- **On-chain certification** — mints a permanent record on Stellar that acts as a "digital birth certificate" for the asset.
- **Trustless third-party verification** — external apps can verify media without relying on a central authority.
- **Secure encryption and access control** — protects sensitive media while allowing controlled sharing.
- **Developer APIs** — simplifies integration of trust verification into existing workflows.

---

## 🚀 Core Architecture

StellarVeriphy combines **Web2 infrastructure** (speed and storage) with **Web3 trust guarantees** (immutability and verification).

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 📂 Media Provenance Verification
- Upload images, videos, documents, or AI-generated media.
- Attach a JSON manifest describing origin metadata (creator, timestamp, device info).
- Generate immutable authenticity certificates on Stellar.

### 🔐 Encryption & Access Control (KMS)
- Encrypts media before it enters the storage layer.
- Controls decryption permissions — creators specify who can view content.
- Supports key rotation and audit trails for enterprise-grade security.

### 🧠 Trusted Off-Chain Verification (TEE Oracle)
- **AWS Nitro Enclaves** provide a highly isolated compute environment.
- **Oracle Worker Nodes** orchestrate data flow between storage and the TEE.
- **Cryptographic Attestation** — the TEE generates a signed proof that verification ran correctly.

### 📜 On-Chain Provenance Certificates (Soroban)
Each minted certificate contains:
- Storage reference ID (IPFS CID or DB ID)
- Manifest hash
- Attestation proof hash
- Timestamp and creator identity (Stellar public key)

### 🧪 Proof-as-a-Service APIs
- `POST /api/verify/submit` — submit media for verification
- `GET /api/verify/status/:jobId` — check verification status
- `POST /api/webhook` — receive real-time callbacks

See [docs/api](docs/api/README.md) for the implemented endpoints, [versioning](docs/api/versioning.md), and the [error format](docs/api/errors.md).

> **Note:** This README is intentionally long and comprehensive. It documents the _current_ code in this repository (Soroban contracts, shared TypeScript utilities, and the Next.js frontend skeleton) and explains how the pieces are meant to work together.

---

## 1. Project overview

**StellarVeriphy** is a decentralized platform for **digital content verification** and **provenance** on the **Stellar** blockchain.

In practice, “verification” means: given some piece of media (an image, video, document, or other binary asset) and some metadata that claims an origin (“who created it”, “when it was produced”, “what device produced it”, “which AI model was used”, etc.), the system must provide cryptographic evidence that:

1. The content has not been altered since verification.
2. The metadata (the “manifest”) corresponds to the content.
3. A trusted verification process ran (for example, an oracle backed by a Trusted Execution Environment).
4. The final result is recorded **immutably** on-chain, so any third party can audit and verify the certificate without trusting a central authority.

StellarVeriphy implements this design by splitting the system into two main trust layers:

- **Off-chain / Web2 layer**: fast storage and orchestration (e.g., IPFS or MongoDB for asset bytes and manifests).
- **On-chain / Web3 layer**: immutable verification records on Stellar using **Soroban smart contracts**.

The platform’s core outcome is an on-chain **“provenance certificate”**—a record minted on Stellar that binds together:

- a reference to where the asset bytes live (e.g., an IPFS CID or a database id),
- a cryptographic hash of the manifest,
- a cryptographic hash of an attestation proof that verification happened in a trusted way,
- and the creator identity (an on-chain address).

The code in this repository also includes an additional **registry** of approved **TEE code hashes** and approved **oracle provider keys**, which is used to gate who can attest and which trusted code is acceptable.

---

## 2. Repository layout (monorepo)

This repository is managed as a **pnpm workspace**.

Top-level:

- `package.json` — workspace scripts and tooling.
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — workspace package discovery.
- `tsconfig.base.json` — shared TypeScript config.

Main components:

1. **`frontend/`** — Next.js application.
2. **`contracts/`** — Rust/Soroban smart contracts:
   - `contracts/oracle/`
   - `contracts/provenance/`
   - `contracts/registry/`
3. **`packages/shared/`** — shared TypeScript types and hashing utilities.

### 2.1. Why a monorepo?

A monorepo is especially useful here because the system relies on a consistent definition of:

- what a “manifest” is,
- how hashes are computed,
- which parameters are passed from the off-chain world into on-chain calls,
- and which verification states exist.

Keeping `packages/shared` close to both the frontend and the contracts reduces the risk of mismatched hashing or schema drift.

For network setup, initialization, verification, and rollback, see the full [Contract Deployment Process](docs/deployment.md).

---

## 3. Stellar concepts used by the contracts

The contracts use the **Soroban SDK** (Rust → WASM). The important building blocks include:

- `Env` — execution environment, provides storage, ledger time, crypto, etc.
- Contract storage types:
  - `env.storage().instance()` for contract instance data (persistent across calls; commonly used for configuration)
  - `env.storage().persistent()` for long-lived mappings
  - `env.storage().temporary()` for state that should expire
- Cross-contract calls via `env.invoke_contract(...)` and generated contract clients.
- Contract events via `env.events().publish(...)` or typed `#[contractevent]` events.
- Cryptographic verification via `env.crypto().ed25519_verify(...)`.

computeAmountValidation Validation Fix

1. Issue

"frontend/src/lib/validation.ts" contains "computeAmountValidation", which currently parses numeric input before checking whether the original string is malformed.

This can allow malformed values, such as repeated decimal points, to be temporarily interpreted as valid numbers before failing later.

The validation order should be:

Raw input
   ↓
Validate numeric format
   ↓
Reject malformed input
   ↓
Parse float
   ↓
Check zero
   ↓
Existing behavior

---

2. Goal

Make the smallest possible change so malformed numeric strings are rejected before float parsing and zero comparison.

The existing behavior for valid amounts must remain unchanged.

---

3. Scope

Only modify:

frontend/src/lib/validation.ts

and its immediately related test file.

Do not introduce:

- New dependencies
- New modules
- New validation frameworks
- UI changes
- Broad refactoring
- Changes to unrelated functions

---

4. Implementation

1. Open "frontend/src/lib/validation.ts".
2. Locate "computeAmountValidation".
3. Identify where numeric parsing currently happens.
4. Identify the existing malformed-string validation.
5. Move/add the smallest possible guard so malformed input is rejected first.
6. Leave the existing float parsing and zero comparison unchanged.
7. Preserve the current return values and error behavior.

Conceptually:

if input is malformed:
    return existing invalid result

parse input
check zero
continue existing logic

---

5. Regression Test

Find the existing validation test:

rg "computeAmountValidation" frontend/

Add one focused regression test covering the malformed numeric case, such as a value containing repeated decimal points.

The test should confirm that:

malformed input → invalid result

The test should fail against the old implementation and pass after the fix.

---

6. Preserve Existing Behavior

Do not change how valid amounts are handled.

Existing cases such as valid integers and decimals should continue producing exactly the same results.

Do not change:

- Zero handling
- Error messages
- Function signatures
- UI behavior
- State management
- Numeric formatting rules

unless directly required by the existing contract.

---

7. Validation Commands

Run the focused test first.

Then run the frontend package tests.

Where configured, also run:

npm run typecheck
npm run lint

and:

npm run build

The exact commands should follow the repository's existing scripts.

---

8. Review

Check:

git diff -- frontend/src/lib/validation.ts

The implementation should be a small, easily reviewable change.

Confirm:

- [ ] Malformed input is rejected before parsing.
- [ ] Zero comparison happens after syntax validation.
- [ ] Valid input behaves exactly as before.
- [ ] One regression test was added.
- [ ] Tests pass.
- [ ] No dependencies were added.
- [ ] No unrelated files were changed.
- [ ] No broad refactor was introduced.

---

9. Definition of Done

The issue is complete when "computeAmountValidation" validates the original numeric string before converting it to a float, the malformed-input regression test passes, and the existing frontend validation behavior remains unchanged.

The goal is a small code diff with a clear validation boundary.
Below is the same style of implementation README, expanded into a detailed contributor guide while keeping the actual code change intentionally small.

computeAmountValidation Malformed Numeric Input Validation

Issue

Reject malformed numeric strings before float parsing

"frontend/src/lib/validation.ts" contains the "computeAmountValidation" function, which currently parses floating-point values before completely validating that the original input is a well-formed numeric string.

This ordering creates an incorrect validation flow.

Malformed numeric strings can temporarily become values that appear valid after parsing or normalization. The input may then fail at a later validation step, state transition, or UI operation.

The correct behavior is to validate the numeric string first and reject malformed input before:

float parsing

and before:

zero comparison

The intended fix is deliberately small.

The implementation should add the minimum validation guard necessary to ensure malformed numeric strings are rejected before they can enter the existing numeric validation path.

---

1. Background

The affected function is:

frontend/src/lib/validation.ts

Specifically:

computeAmountValidation

This function is responsible for validating an amount entered by the user.

The current implementation performs floating-point parsing before fully validating the textual representation of the amount.

Conceptually, the problematic flow looks like:

user input
    |
    v
parse float
    |
    v
zero comparison
    |
    v
malformed-input validation

The desired flow is:

user input
    |
    v
validate numeric string
    |
    v
reject malformed input
    |
    v
parse float
    |
    v
zero comparison
    |
    v
existing validation behavior

The difference is small in code but important in behavior.

---

2. Problem Statement

The current validation sequence allows malformed numeric strings to reach the numeric parsing stage before their textual structure has been validated.

This can create several undesirable outcomes.

A malformed input may:

1. Be partially normalized by numeric parsing.
2. Temporarily look like a valid number.
3. Pass one validation stage.
4. Fail at a later stage.
5. Produce an error unrelated to the original malformed input.
6. Cause an unexpected state transition.
7. Make debugging harder.
8. Create inconsistent UI behavior.
9. Make validation boundaries less explicit.
10. Create a weaker security boundary than intended.

The issue is therefore not simply about formatting.

The important property is validation order.

---

3. Core Requirement

Malformed numeric strings must be rejected before floating-point parsing and before the zero comparison.

The desired sequence is:

raw input
   |
   v
numeric-string validation
   |
   +---- invalid ----> reject
   |
   v
float parsing
   |
   v
zero comparison
   |
   v
existing validation result

The existing normal path should otherwise remain unchanged.

---

4. Scope

The change must remain tightly scoped.

Expected files:

frontend/src/lib/validation.ts

and the immediately related test file.

Do not introduce:

new dependencies
new modules
new validation libraries
new utilities
large refactors
unrelated UI changes

The implementation should be a small guard or validation-order correction.

---

5. Primary Objective

Change "computeAmountValidation" so that malformed numeric strings are rejected before they are converted into floating-point values.

The fix should preserve:

- Existing valid-input behavior.
- Existing error behavior where applicable.
- Existing UI behavior.
- Existing return types.
- Existing function signature.
- Existing validation contract.
- Existing dependency structure.

Only the malformed-input boundary should change.

---

6. Important Principle

Do not attempt to redesign numeric validation.

This issue does not require a new validation framework.

It does not require:

schema libraries

or:

custom parsing packages

or:

global validation utilities

The safest solution is to make the existing validation order explicit.

---

7. First Step — Inspect the Function

Open:

frontend/src/lib/validation.ts

Locate:

computeAmountValidation

Read the complete function before editing it.

Do not immediately change the first suspicious line.

Understand:

- Its input type.
- Its return type.
- Existing validation branches.
- Existing defaults.
- Existing state-related behavior.
- Existing error messages.
- Existing numeric parsing.
- Existing zero checks.
- Existing malformed-input checks.

---

8. Inspect Surrounding Functions

Read the surrounding code in:

frontend/src/lib/validation.ts

Determine whether:

computeAmountValidation

uses helper functions.

Look for functions responsible for:

- Numeric validation.
- Decimal validation.
- Empty input validation.
- Amount formatting.
- Parsing.
- Error generation.

The goal is to use the existing validation contract rather than duplicate logic unnecessarily.

---

9. Identify the Current Order

The investigation should explicitly identify where the current function does:

parseFloat(...)

or an equivalent numeric conversion.

Then identify where it checks:

<= 0

or equivalent zero validation.

Finally identify where it checks for malformed numeric syntax.

The issue exists if malformed syntax is evaluated only after parsing.

---

10. Why Parse Order Matters

A string and its parsed numeric representation are different things.

For example:

"123.45"

is a textual representation.

After parsing:

123.45

the original textual structure is no longer available in the same form.

That distinction matters when validating:

- Decimal points.
- Repeated decimal points.
- Invalid characters.
- Partial numeric strings.
- Unexpected formatting.

The raw string should therefore be validated before its numeric representation becomes authoritative.

---

11. Repeated Decimal Points

One important malformed-input category is repeated decimal points.

For example:

12.34.56

should not be treated as a valid amount.

The exact expected behavior should be determined from the existing validation contract and tests.

The new regression test should target the malformed case described by the issue.

Do not broaden the accepted/rejected syntax unnecessarily.

---

12. Malformed Numeric Strings

The implementation should distinguish between:

valid numeric string

and:

malformed numeric string

before parsing.

Examples of potentially malformed values include:

1.2.3

or other strings that violate the function's existing numeric format.

The test should use the smallest representative malformed value that demonstrates the bug.

---

13. Do Not Change Valid Inputs

Valid inputs should continue through the existing path.

Examples may include:

1
10
10.5
100.00

depending on the existing contract.

The cleanup should not accidentally reject valid decimal amounts.

---

14. Do Not Change Zero Semantics

The issue specifically concerns validation order.

Do not redesign the existing zero check.

If the current function rejects:

0

then it should continue to reject it.

If it handles another zero-equivalent representation according to an established contract, preserve that behavior.

The change should simply ensure malformed strings are rejected first.

---

15. Do Not Change Function Signature

Keep the existing:

computeAmountValidation(...)

signature.

Do not introduce:

computeAmountValidationV2(...)

or:

validateAmount(...)

unless the existing code absolutely requires it.

It should not.

---

16. Do Not Add Dependencies

Do not add a package for numeric validation.

The issue should be solvable with the validation mechanisms already present in the project.

Adding a dependency would increase:

- Bundle complexity.
- Maintenance cost.
- Review scope.
- Security surface.
- Installation requirements.

The requested change is intentionally small.

---

17. Inspect the Existing Tests

Locate the immediately related test file.

Search for:

computeAmountValidation

using:

rg "computeAmountValidation" frontend/

Then inspect the existing test cases.

Understand how the project currently tests:

- Valid amounts.
- Invalid amounts.
- Zero.
- Decimal values.
- Empty values.
- Error messages.
- Return values.

The regression test should match the existing testing style.

---

18. Identify the Exact Regression Case

The test should reproduce the current bug before the implementation is changed.

The intended test scenario is:

malformed numeric string
        |
        v
computeAmountValidation
        |
        v
invalid result

The test should demonstrate that the malformed value is rejected at the validation boundary.

Do not merely test that some later operation fails.

---

19. Why the Regression Test Matters

A regression test proves that the issue is behavioral.

Without it, the code change could look like a stylistic refactor.

The test should demonstrate:

before:
malformed input reaches numeric parsing

and after the fix:

malformed input is rejected before parsing

This gives reviewers confidence that the patch addresses the actual bug.

---

20. Test the Normal Path

The existing normal-path tests should remain unchanged unless the new validation guard requires a small adjustment.

For example:

valid amount
    |
    v
existing validation result

must continue to work.

The «Does "computeAmountValidation" reject this malformed numeric string before it can be treated as a parsed number?»

---


---

36. Narrow Test Command

Use the narrowest relevant test command first.

For example, depending on the project:

npm test -- validation

or:

npx vitest frontend/src/.../validation.test.ts

or the project's documented equivalent.

Use the actual test runner configured by the repository.

Do not invent a command if the project uses a different setup.

---

37. Package-Level Test

After the focused test passes, run the affected frontend package's normal test command.

For example:

npm test

or:

npm run test

depending on the repository.

The objective is to ensure the small validation change does not break neighboring behavior.

---

38. Type Checking

If the frontend package supports TypeScript checking, run the existing command.

Potential examples include:

npm run typecheck

or:

npx tsc --noEmit

Use the project's configured command.

Do not introduce a new TypeScript configuration.

---

39. Linting

If linting is part of the package workflow, run it.

For example:

npm run lint

The change should not introduce:

- unused variables.
- unreachable code.
- formatting errors.
- unsafe coercions.

---

40. Build

A full production build is optional if the repository's normal validation requires it.

If the package uses:

npm run build

and this is normally required for frontend changes, run it.

Otherwise, the narrow test and package validation may be sufficient for this small change.

---

41. Verify the Diff

Run:

git diff -- frontend/src/lib/validation.ts

and the relevant test file.

The diff should be small.

A reviewer should be able to understand the entire change quickly.

---

42. Expected Diff Shape

The expected change should generally look like:

validation.ts
    + malformed-input guard
    existing parse
    existing zero check
    existing logic

validation.test.ts
    + one regression test

It should not become:

validation.ts
    hundreds of changed lines

new validation utilities
new dependencies
new components
new state management

That would violate the scope.

---

43. Do Not Refactor Existing Validation

Avoid renaming every validation helper.

Avoid reorganizing the entire file.

Avoid converting:

function A
function B
function C

into a new architecture.

Even if the existing file could be improved, that is a separate task.

---

44. Do Not Change Formatting Unnecessarily

If formatting tools modify unrelated sections, inspect the diff carefully.

Do not include unrelated formatting changes in the PR if they can be avoided.

The ideal patch is focused.

---

45. Boundary Conditions

The main boundary is:

malformed string

versus:

valid numeric string

The implementation should not accidentally shift other boundaries.

Pay attention to:

empty string
null/undefined if supported
zero
positive integers
positive decimals
negative values if supported
multiple decimal points
non-numeric characters

Only the issue-specific behavior should change.

---

46. Empty Input

Determine how the current function handles:

""

Do not automatically treat it the same as the repeated-decimal case.

Preserve the existing contract unless the malformed-input guard naturally covers it.

---

47. Negative Values

Determine whether negative amounts are already rejected.

If they are, preserve that behavior.

Do not introduce new negative-number rules.

The issue is about validation ordering, not amount policy.

---

48. Whitespace

Determine whether whitespace is currently:

trimmed

or:

rejected

Do not silently change this behavior.

A validation-order fix should not become a whitespace-policy change.

---

49. Leading Zeros

Determine whether values such as:

0010

are currently valid.

Do not change their behavior unless the existing contract explicitly says otherwise.

---

50. Decimal Representation

Determine what the existing function considers a valid decimal representation.

Potential forms may include:

10.5
10.50
0.5

but the exact accepted forms belong to the existing contract.

The regression fix should not redefine them.

---

51. Floating-Point Limitations

Do not attempt to solve general JavaScript floating-point precision issues in this task.

For example:

0.1 + 0.2

is unrelated to the malformed-string validation issue.

Do not introduce decimal arithmetic libraries.

---

52. Numeric Coercion

Inspect whether the function uses:

parseFloat
Number
parseInt

or another mechanism.

Regardless of parser choice, the raw string must be validated according to the existing contract before conversion.

---

53. Partial Parse Risk

One reason ordering matters is that some parsing APIs can accept a valid numeric prefix while ignoring trailing invalid content.

Conceptually:

"123abc"

can potentially produce a numeric result from the prefix depending on the parser.

This is why raw-string validation must establish that the entire input conforms to the expected numeric syntax.

The exact behavior should be confirmed against the project's current parser.

---

54. Repeated Decimal Risk

Likewise, an input such as:

12.3.4

is not a valid decimal representation even if a parser can extract a numeric prefix.

The validator must reject the original string before treating the parsed number as authoritative.

---

55. Correct State Flow

The final function should conceptually implement:

                    raw input
                       |
                       v
              ┌─────────────────┐
              │ Numeric syntax  │
              │    valid?       │
              └────────┬────────┘
                       |
              ┌────────┴────────┐
              |                 |
             No                Yes
              |                 |
              v                 v
           Reject             Parse
                                |
                                v
                         Zero comparison
                                |
                                v
                       Existing validation

This is the behavior reviewers should be able to recognize directly in the code.

---

56. No New State

The fix should not introduce new application state.

Do not add:

validationState
parsedAmountState
numericInputState

The existing function should remain responsible for the validation result.

---

57. No New Module

Do not create:

numericValidation.ts
amountParser.ts
amountUtils.ts

The issue specifically calls for a scoped correction in:

frontend/src/lib/validation.ts

---

58. No Dependency

Do not add:

validator
zod
yup
decimal.js
big.js

or similar packages.

The existing implementation should be sufficient.

---

59. Security Review Consideration

Although the code change is small, reviewers should consider whether malformed values can reach a security-sensitive operation.

If "computeAmountValidation" gates:

transaction amounts
payments
financial operations
API requests

then rejecting malformed input before parsing is particularly important.

The patch should make the boundary deterministic.

---

60. Do Not Overstate the Security Impact

The issue description mentions a security boundary.
one negative test proving a zero or over-limit page size has explicit, bounded behavior, plus a regression test proving normal pages are untouched.

 `<angle_brackets>` must be replaced with real names from the contract. Where the contract doesn't answer a question, this spec says to flag it rather than invent a limit.

---

## 0. Scope and Rules

**In scope**
- One negative test for a single invalid page size (zero **or** over-limit).
- One regression test for a normal page size.
- Running the attestation pagination tests.

**Out of scope**
- Adding a new max constant or limit unless the contract interface already defines one.
- Changing the pagination signature.
- Refactoring storage or indexing.

**Hard rules**
1. Inspect before writing. The contract decides the expected behavior, not this document.
2. Use the contract's own constant for boundaries. Never hardcode a number the contract could change.
3. Assert either a stable error **or** documented clamping. Never assert "it doesn't crash."
4. If no bound exists today, stop and report it. That is a finding, not a test to fake.

---

## 1. Inspect the Current Contract

### 1.1 Find the pagination entrypoint

```bash
cd <repo-root>
grep -rn "fn list_\|fn get_.*attest\|fn .*page\|fn .*paginat\|fn query_" \
  contracts/attestation/src
```

Look for functions with a shape like:

```rust
pub fn list_attestations(
    env: Env,
    subject: Address,
    start: u32,      // offset or cursor
    limit: u32,      // THE size argument
) -> Vec<Attestation>
```

Record the answers:

| Question | Answer (fill in) |
|---|---|
| Function name | `<list_fn>` |
| Size arg name | `<limit \| page_size \| count>` |
| Size arg type | `<u32 \| u64>` |
| Start arg style | `<offset \| cursor \| page_number>` |
| Return type | `<Vec<T> \| Page<T>>` |
| Return includes next cursor? | `<yes/no>` |

### 1.2 Find any published maximum

```bash
grep -rn "MAX_\|max_page\|MAX_LIMIT\|PAGE_SIZE\|DEFAULT_LIMIT" \
  contracts/attestation/src
grep -rn -i "page size\|limit\|maximum\|pagination" \
  contracts/attestation/README.md docs/ 2>/dev/null
```

Check three places, since "published" can mean any of them:
- A `const` in the contract source.
- The doc comment on the function.
- The README, interface docs, or a generated spec.

| Item | Found? | Value | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| Max page size const | | | |
| Default page size const | | | |
| Documented in README/interface | | | |
| Doc comment on function | | | |

### 1.3 Find the current validation behavior

Read the function body and note what happens for each input:

```rust
// Pattern A: explicit error
if limit == 0 || limit > MAX_PAGE_SIZE {
    return Err(Error::InvalidPageSize);
}

// Pattern B: clamp
let limit = limit.min(MAX_PAGE_SIZE);

// Pattern C: clamp with zero default
let limit = if limit == 0 { DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE } else { limit.min(MAX_PAGE_SIZE) };

// Pattern D: panic
assert!(limit > 0 && limit <= MAX_PAGE_SIZE, "bad limit");

// Pattern E: nothing at all (unbounded)
for i in start..(start + limit) { ... }
```

Fill in the behavior table:

| Input | Current behavior | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| `limit = 0` | | |
| `limit = MAX` | | |
| `limit = MAX + 1` | | |
| `limit = u32::MAX` | | |
| `start` beyond total | | |
| empty collection | | |

### 1.4 Check for existing tests

```bash
grep -rn "pagination\|limit\|page" contracts/attestation/src/test*.rs \
  contracts/attestation/tests 2>/dev/null
ls contracts/attestation/src | grep -i test
```

Note the test file location, the helper names (setup functions, fixtures), and whether a pagination test already exists. Extend that file. Don't create a parallel one.

### 1.5 Check the contract interface

If the project publishes an interface (spec JSON, TypeScript bindings, docs):

```bash
stellar contract bindings typescript --help   # if bindings are generated
grep -rn "list_\|limit" bindings/ 2>/dev/null
```

Rule: **a change that alters the published interface needs explicit sign-off.** A test alone should not touch it.

---

## 2. Decide Which Behavior to Test

Use this matrix after Section 1.

| Situation found | Test to write | Expected assertion |
|---|---|---|
| Error exists for over-limit | Over-limit test | Specific error variant |
| Error exists for zero only | Zero test | Specific error variant |
| Clamp exists, documented | Over-limit test | `len == MAX` |
| Clamp exists, undocumented | Report; test clamp only if the team confirms it as the contract | `len == MAX` |
| Panic on invalid | Over-limit test with `try_` call | Contract error / `Err` |
| **No bound at all** | **Do not write a passing test.** Flag it | Open a decision: error vs clamp |

### 2.1 Pick exactly ONE invalid case

The task says "one invalid size." Choose:

- **Max constant exists** → test `MAX_PAGE_SIZE + 1`.
- **Only a zero guard exists** → test `0`.
- **Both exist** → pick over-limit, since it directly proves the response is bounded.

### 2.2 If there is no bound

Write this up instead of a test:

```
FINDING: <list_fn> accepts any u32 for <limit>. With N attestations stored,
a request of u32::MAX attempts to return all N records in one call.
No published maximum exists in source, docs, or interface.

DECISION NEEDED (owner of contract interface):
  Option 1: reject with Error::InvalidPageSize for 0 or > MAX
  Option 2: clamp to MAX, document it
  
This task does not add a limit. Test deferred until the contract defines one.
```

That satisfies the acceptance criterion "no new limit is added without checking the contract interface."

---

## 3. Choose the Boundary Value

Boundaries come from the contract, not from guesses.

```rust
use crate::{MAX_PAGE_SIZE, Error};          // adjust paths
// or, if the const is private:
// use crate::constants::MAX_PAGE_SIZE;
```

| Case | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Zero | `0` | Degenerate size; often an off-by-one trap |
| Just over | `MAX_PAGE_SIZE + 1` | The tightest violation |
| Exactly at max | `MAX_PAGE_SIZE` | Must still succeed |
| Just under | `MAX_PAGE_SIZE - 1` | Must still succeed |
| Extreme | `u32::MAX` | Catches overflow and unbounded loops |

**Overflow caution:** if `MAX_PAGE_SIZE` could be `u32::MAX`, then `MAX + 1` wraps. Use `checked_add` or test `u32::MAX` directly:

```rust
let over = MAX_PAGE_SIZE.checked_add(1).expect("max is u32::MAX; use a different invalid case");
```

If the const is private and the test crate can't import it, ask whether it should be exposed to tests with `pub(crate)` or `#[cfg(test)]`. Don't copy the literal.

---

## 4. Test Harness

Reuse existing helpers if the test module has them. These are the minimum shapes needed.

### 4.1 Imports

```rust
#![cfg(test)]

use soroban_sdk::{testutils::Address as _, Address, Env, String, Vec};

use crate::{
    <ContractName>, <ContractName>Client, Error, MAX_PAGE_SIZE,
    // plus the Attestation type, if needed
};
```

### 4.2 Setup helper

```rust
struct Fixture<'a> {
    env: Env,
    client: <ContractName>Client<'a>,
    subject: Address,
    issuer: Address,
}

fn setup<'a>() -> Fixture<'a> {
    let env = Env::default();
    env.mock_all_auths();

    let contract_id = env.register(<ContractName>, ());
    let client = <ContractName>Client::new(&env, &contract_id);

    let admin = Address::generate(&env);
    let issuer = Address::generate(&env);
    let subject = Address::generate(&env);

    // Only if the contract needs init / issuer registration:
    // client.initialize(&admin);
    // client.register_issuer(&issuer);

    Fixture { env, client, subject, issuer }
}
```

### 4.3 Seeding helper

Seed a known number of records so assertions are exact.

```rust
fn seed(f: &Fixture, n: u32) {
    for i in 0..n {
        // Use the REAL attest/create function and signature.
        f.client.<attest_fn>(
            &f.issuer,
            &f.subject,
            &String::from_str(&f.env, &format!("claim-{}", i)),
            // ...other required args
        );
    }
}
```

Notes:
- `format!` isn't available in `no_std` contract code, but it **is** available in test code when the `std` feature is enabled for tests. If it isn't, build the string from a fixed set or use a counter-derived `BytesN`.
- Soroban test budgets are finite. If seeding `MAX_PAGE_SIZE + 10` records exhausts the budget, call `env.cost_estimate().budget().reset_unlimited()` in the test, and only there.

```rust
f.env.cost_estimate().budget().reset_unlimited();
```

### 4.4 Large-seed guard

```rust
// Seeding cost scales with MAX_PAGE_SIZE. If MAX is large (e.g. 1000),
// keep the dataset to MAX + small margin, not far above.
const SEED_MARGIN: u32 = 5;
```

---

## 5. The Negative Test

Write **one** of 5A or 5B, depending on Section 2.

### 5A. Contract returns a stable error

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_rejects_over_limit_page_size() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 5);

    let over_limit = MAX_PAGE_SIZE + 1;
    let res = f.client.try_<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &over_limit);

    // Stable error: assert the exact variant, not just is_err().
    assert_eq!(res, Err(Ok(Error::InvalidPageSize)));
}
```

**Why this shape**
- `try_` returns `Result<Result<T, ConversionError>, Result<Error, InvokeError>>`. The outer `Err(Ok(Error::X))` is a contract-defined error. Adjust the nesting if your SDK version differs.
- Asserting the exact variant makes the error part of the contract. A refactor that changes the variant fails the test.
- The seeded count (5) is deliberately small. The point is that the request is rejected regardless of how many records exist.

### 5A-zero. Zero variant

Use this instead if only zero is guarded:

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_rejects_zero_page_size() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 5);

    let res = f.client.try_<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &0u32);

    assert_eq!(res, Err(Ok(Error::InvalidPageSize)));
}
```

### 5B. Contract documents clamping

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_clamps_over_limit_page_size_to_max() {
    let f = setup();
    f.env.cost_estimate().budget().reset_unlimited();
    seed(&f, MAX_PAGE_SIZE + SEED_MARGIN);

    let page = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &(MAX_PAGE_SIZE + 1));

    // Bounded: exactly MAX, not total, not MAX+1.
    assert_eq!(page.len(), MAX_PAGE_SIZE);
}
```

### 5B-zero. Clamp-to-default variant

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_zero_page_size_uses_default() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE + SEED_MARGIN);

    let page = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &0u32);

    assert_eq!(page.len(), DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE);
}
```

### 5.1 What "stable" means

A stable error is:
- A named `contract_error` variant with a fixed numeric code.
- Not a string-matched panic message.
- Not dependent on dataset size.

Check the error enum:

```rust
#[contracterror]
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
#[repr(u32)]
pub enum Error {
    // ...
    InvalidPageSize = <n>,   // numeric value is part of the contract
}
```

If the contract panics with a string instead of returning an error, assert that in a `#[should_panic(expected = "...")]` test **only** if that panic is the documented behavior. Then note in the PR that a typed error would be more stable. Don't change it in this task.

---

## 6. The Regression Test (Normal Page Size)

This proves the validation didn't break the happy path.

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_normal_page_size_returns_expected_records() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 5);

    let page = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &3u32);

    assert_eq!(page.len(), 3);

    // Check content and order, not only the count.
    for i in 0..3u32 {
        let a = page.get(i).unwrap();
        assert_eq!(a.subject, f.subject);
        // assert_eq!(a.id, <expected_id_for_i>);
    }
}
```

### 6.1 Second page

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_second_page_continues_after_first() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 5);

    let p1 = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &3u32);
    let p2 = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &3u32, &3u32); // adjust for cursor style

    assert_eq!(p1.len(), 3);
    assert_eq!(p2.len(), 2);

    // No overlap between pages.
    for a in p1.iter() {
        for b in p2.iter() {
            assert_ne!(a.id, b.id);
        }
    }
}
```

If pagination is cursor-based, replace the second call with the cursor returned from the first page.

### 6.2 Exactly-at-max succeeds

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_exact_max_page_size_succeeds() {
    let f = setup();
    f.env.cost_estimate().budget().reset_unlimited();
    seed(&f, MAX_PAGE_SIZE + SEED_MARGIN);

    let page = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &MAX_PAGE_SIZE);

    assert_eq!(page.len(), MAX_PAGE_SIZE);
}
```

This guards against an off-by-one where the check is `>=` instead of `>`.

### 6.3 Page size larger than the dataset

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_page_size_above_total_but_under_max_returns_all() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 4);

    let page = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &10u32); // 10 <= MAX

    assert_eq!(page.len(), 4);
}
```

---

## 7. Optional Edge Tests

Add these only if cheap and only if the contract behavior is clear. The task asks for one invalid-size negative test, so keep extras in the regression category.

### 7.1 Empty collection

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_on_empty_set_returns_empty() {
    let f = setup();

    let page = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &5u32);

    assert_eq!(page.len(), 0);
}
```

### 7.2 Start beyond the end

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_start_beyond_total_returns_empty() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 3);

    let page = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &100u32, &5u32);

    assert_eq!(page.len(), 0);
}
```

Confirm the current behavior first. If the contract errors here, assert the error instead. Never assume.

### 7.3 Extreme value

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_u32_max_page_size_is_bounded() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 5);

    let res = f.client.try_<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &u32::MAX);

    // Error contract:
    assert_eq!(res, Err(Ok(Error::InvalidPageSize)));
    // Clamp contract: assert len <= MAX_PAGE_SIZE instead.
}
```

### 7.4 Start + limit overflow

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_start_plus_limit_does_not_overflow() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 3);

    // start near u32::MAX with a valid limit must not panic on addition.
    let res = f.client.try_<list_fn>(&f.subject, &(u32::MAX - 1), &5u32);

    assert!(res.is_ok()); // returns empty, never wraps into early indexes
    assert_eq!(res.unwrap().unwrap().len(), 0);
}
```

This catches `start + limit` wrapping into valid indexes, a real source of unbounded or wrong responses.

### 7.5 Other subjects unaffected

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_only_returns_requested_subjects_records() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 3);
    let other = Address::generate(&f.env);
    // attest for `other` once
    f.client.<attest_fn>(&f.issuer, &other, &String::from_str(&f.env, "x"));

    let page = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &10u32);

    assert_eq!(page.len(), 3);
}
```

---

## 8. Proving the Response Is Bounded

"Bounded" should be demonstrated, not inferred from `len`.

### 8.1 Length assertion (clamp contracts)

```rust
assert!(page.len() <= MAX_PAGE_SIZE);
```

### 8.2 Budget assertion

If the project tracks resource cost, compare the cost of a max-size page to an invalid request:

```rust
#[test]
fn invalid_page_size_is_rejected_cheaply() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 5);

    f.env.cost_estimate().budget().reset_default();
    let _ = f.client.try_<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &(MAX_PAGE_SIZE + 1));
    let cpu = f.env.cost_estimate().budget().cpu_instruction_cost();

    // Rejection should happen before iteration; keep the threshold loose.
    assert!(cpu < <GENEROUS_BOUND>);
}
```

Only include this if the repo already uses budget assertions. A new brittle numeric threshold isn't worth adding. If you include it, set the bound well above observed cost.

### 8.3 Validation order

Validation must happen **before** reading storage:

```rust
// good
if limit == 0 || limit > MAX_PAGE_SIZE { return Err(Error::InvalidPageSize); }
let items = read_storage(...);

// bad: reads everything, then trims
let items = read_storage(...);
if items.len() > MAX_PAGE_SIZE { ... }
```

Review the function body for this. If the order is wrong, report it. That's a contract fix outside this task.

---

## 9. Run the Tests

### 9.1 Targeted

```bash
cargo test -p <attestation-crate> pagination -- --nocapture
```

### 9.2 Full attestation suite

```bash
cargo test -p <attestation-crate>
```

### 9.3 Workspace sanity

```bash
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy -p <attestation-crate> --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

### 9.4 Confirm the test actually tests something

Mutation check, done locally and not committed:

1. In the contract, temporarily change `limit > MAX_PAGE_SIZE` to `limit > MAX_PAGE_SIZE + 1`.
2. Run the negative test.
3. It must **fail**.
4. Revert the change.

If it still passes, the boundary value isn't hitting the guard. Fix the test.

Repeat for the zero guard (`limit == 0` → `limit == 1`) if you wrote the zero test.

### 9.5 Expected output

```
running 4 tests
test tests::pagination_rejects_over_limit_page_size ... ok
test tests::pagination_normal_page_size_returns_expected_records ... ok
test tests::pagination_exact_max_page_size_succeeds ... ok
test tests::pagination_second_page_continues_after_first ... ok

test result: ok. 4 passed; 0 failed
```

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_PAGE_SIZE` not found | Private const | Ask to expose with `pub(crate)`; don't hardcode |
| `try_` result shape mismatch | SDK version | Match against the existing tests' `try_` handling |
| Budget exceeded while seeding | Large `MAX` | `budget().reset_unlimited()` inside the test only |
| Negative test passes before any guard exists | Contract panics generically | Inspect the failure; assert the real error or report the gap |
| Negative test passes with the guard mutated | Wrong boundary value | Use `MAX + 1`, not an arbitrary large number |
| `MAX + 1` overflows | `MAX == u32::MAX` | Use `checked_add` or test a different case |
| Order assertions flaky | Storage iteration unordered | Assert as a set, or sort by id before comparing |
| Test passes locally, fails in CI | Different feature flags | Run with the CI command and flags |
| Seeded records leak between tests | Shared env | Each test calls `setup()` for a fresh `Env` |

---

## 11. Documentation Rules

Update docs **only** to reflect behavior that already exists.

- Error contract exists but isn't documented → add one line to the function doc comment and the README naming the error and the max.
- Clamp exists but isn't documented → document it, and tell the team the behavior is now stated.
- No bound exists → **change no docs.** Report the finding (Section 2.2).

Suggested doc comment, if the behavior already exists:

```rust
/// Returns up to `limit` attestations for `subject`, starting at `start`.
///
/// # Errors
/// * `Error::InvalidPageSize` if `limit == 0` or `limit > MAX_PAGE_SIZE`.
///
/// `MAX_PAGE_SIZE` is <value>. Callers needing more records should page.
pub fn <list_fn>(...)
```

---

## 12. PR Description Template

```markdown
## Summary
Adds a negative test for an invalid pagination size on `<list_fn>`, plus a
regression test for a normal page size.

## What I checked
- Pagination entrypoint: `<list_fn>(subject, start, limit)`
- Published maximum: `MAX_PAGE_SIZE = <n>` in `<file>` (also documented in <README/none>)
- Current behavior: <rejects with Error::InvalidPageSize | clamps to MAX>

## Tests added
- `pagination_rejects_over_limit_page_size`: `MAX_PAGE_SIZE + 1` → `Error::InvalidPageSize`
- `pagination_normal_page_size_returns_expected_records`: limit 3 of 5 → 3 records, correct order
- `pagination_exact_max_page_size_succeeds`: boundary still accepted

## Not changed
- No new limit, constant, or error variant was added.
- Contract interface and README unchanged.

## Verification
- `cargo test -p <crate> pagination` → all pass
- Mutation check: loosening the guard by one makes the negative test fail
- `cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt --check` clean
```

If a finding was reported instead:

```markdown
## Summary
No test added. `<list_fn>` has no page-size bound (see finding below).
Per task criteria, no limit was added without interface review.

## Finding
<paste Section 2.2 text>
```

---

## 13. Acceptance Checklist

**Explicit and bounded**
- [ ] One invalid size (zero or over-limit) is covered by a test.
- [ ] The test asserts a stable error variant **or** the documented clamp length.
- [ ] The boundary value comes from the contract constant, not a literal.
- [ ] The result is demonstrably bounded (`len <= MAX` or rejected before iteration).

**Normal behavior preserved**
- [ ] A normal page size returns the expected records, in order.
- [ ] The exact-max size still succeeds.
- [ ] The second page continues without overlap.

**Contract discipline**

- [ ] No new limit or constant added without checking the interface.
- [ ] No signature, error code number, or event changed.
- [ ] Docs updated only if the behavior already existed.
- [ ] If no bound existed, a finding was filed instead of a test.

**Process**
- [ ] Attestation pagination tests run and pass.
- [ ] Full attestation suite passes.
- [ ] Mutation check proves the test can fail.
- [ ] `clippy` and `fmt` clean.

## 14. Decision Summary

```
Inspect function and constants
        │
        ├── Bound exists, returns error ──► test MAX+1 (or 0), assert exact Error
        │
        ├── Bound exists, clamps ─────────► test MAX+1, assert len == MAX
        │
        └── No bound ─────────────────────► STOP. File finding. No test. No new limit.

Always add: normal-size regression test (+ exact-max test)
Always run: pagination tests, then the full attestation suite
Always confirm: the negative test fails when the guard is loosened
```

---

If you paste the pagination function, the max constant, and the existing test module's setup helpers, I'll replace every `<placeholder>` and give you the final test code as-is.
Do not claim that the existing bug constitutes a confirmed exploit unless the repository or issue provides evidence.

---

66. State Write Requirement

If the function writes state directly or returns a result that causes state to be written, ensure the malformed-input branch happens before that operation.

The principle is:

validate first
write second

not:

write provisional value
validate afterward

---

67. Default Values

Inspect whether "computeAmountValidation" assigns a default value.

If a default assignment is part of the bug, correct only that assignment.

Do not modify unrelated defaults.

The correct default should be established from existing behavior and tests.

---

68. Early Return

An early return may be the clearest implementation if the existing function already uses early returns.

Conceptually:

if invalid input:
    return invalid result

parse input
continue existing code

This keeps the validation boundary obvious.

Follow the project's existing coding style.

---

69. Avoid Nested Complexity

Do not solve the problem by wrapping the entire existing function in additional nested conditions.

Prefer the smallest readable change.

The desired result should be easy to review.

---

70. Keep the Existing Normal Path

A reviewer should be able to compare:

old valid-input path

with:

new valid-input path

and see that they are effectively identical.

Only malformed input should take the new rejection branch.

---

71. Manual Test

If practical, manually exercise the affected UI.

Enter:

normal valid amount

and confirm normal behavior.

Then enter the malformed value used in the regression test.

Confirm that:

invalid input

is rejected immediately according to the existing UI behavior.

Do not make UI code changes simply to perform this test.

---

72. Browser Validation

If the frontend can be run locally, use the existing development command.

For example:

npm run dev

Then exercise the relevant form.

Only do this if the repository's normal workflow makes it practical.

---

73. Package Boundary

Keep all implementation changes inside:

frontend/src/lib/validation.ts

and the immediately related test file.

Do not modify:

backend/
database/
API routes/
global configuration/
package.json/

unless absolutely required by the existing test setup.

---

74. Dependency Lockfile

A lockfile should not change because this issue should not require a dependency.

If:

package-lock.json

or:

yarn.lock

changes unexpectedly, investigate why.

It may indicate that unnecessary package installation occurred.

---

75. Git Diff Requirement

The final diff should remain small.

Review:

git diff --stat

Then:

git diff
# Comprehensive Diagnostic, Architecture & Resolution Guide: TypeScript Module Resolution Misconfiguration (TS5095) in Containerized Build Pipelines

---

## Executive Summary & Root Cause Analysis

In TypeScript 5.0+, the compiler strictly enforces compatibilities between module system targets (`compilerOptions.module`) and module resolution strategies (`compilerOptions.moduleResolution`). 

When `tsconfig.json` specifies:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler"
  }
}

The TypeScript compiler (tsc) immediately aborts during compiler option validation—prior to parsing, AST generation, or type-checking any source files—with the following fatal error:
error TS5095: Option 'bundler' can only be used when 'module' is set to 'preserve' or to 'es2015' or later.

Why This Breakdown Occurs
 * The Role of moduleResolution: "bundler": Introduced in TypeScript 5.0, bundler models how modern frontend/backend bundlers (such as Webpack, Vite, esbuild, SWC, or Rollup) resolve import paths. Bundlers natively support ECMAScript Module (ESM) syntax (import/export), dynamic imports, package .exports fields, and extensions without requiring Node.js legacy CommonJS resolution hacks.
 * The Conflict with module: "commonjs": Setting module: "commonjs" instructs tsc to transform ES module syntax into CommonJS require() calls and exports.foo statements. However, bundler resolution assumes that the downstream bundler—not tsc—handles module emission or that code is strictly written using ESM semantics. Combining commonjs output with modern bundler path resolution is fundamentally contradictory within the TypeScript 5.x type system.
 * Pipeline Propagation:
   * Local development using npx tsc --noEmit fails immediately.
   * Local build scripts running npm run build (defined as tsc && node -e ...) fail.
   * Containerized CI/CD builds running RUN npm run build inside Dockerfile fail at the builder stage, completely blocking image generation and deployment pipelines.

Remediation Strategies & Architectural Trade-offs
To fix TS5095, select the strategy that best aligns with your execution runtime:
| Strategy | module setting | moduleResolution setting | Ideal For | Runtime Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Option A: Pure Node.js CommonJS (Recommended for standard Node) | "CommonJS" | "Node10" (or "Node") | Traditional Node.js without bundlers | CommonJS (require) |
| Option B: Modern Node.js ESM Engine | "Node16" or "NodeNext" | "Node16" or "NodeNext" | Modern Node.js (v18+) with ES Modules | Native ESM (import) |
| Option C: Bundled Build Pipeline | "ES2022" or "Preserve" | "bundler" | Projects processed via esbuild/swc/webpack | Modern ESM emitted to bundler |
Detailed Remediation Implementations
Solution Option A: Target Node.js Legacy CommonJS Runtime (Standard Fix)
If your runtime uses standard Node.js without a bundler (esbuild/tsup/webpack) and relies on CommonJS module loading (require), adjust moduleResolution to match commonjs.

 * Update tsconfig.json to use Node16 or NodeNext for both module and moduleResolution.

Hardened Multi-Stage Dockerfile Execution
The revised Dockerfile below eliminates build failures by implementing layered caching, strict dependency verification via npm ci, and clean multi-stage artifact extraction.
# ==========================================
# Stage 1: Dependency Cache & Build Stage
# ==========================================
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency manifests
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Clean install all dependencies (including devDependencies)
RUN npm ci

# Copy configuration and source files
COPY tsconfig.json ./
COPY src/ ./src/

# Run type check explicitly to validate configuration
RUN npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json

# Execute build script
RUN npm run build

# ==========================================
# Stage 2: Minimal Runtime Stage
# ==========================================
FROM node:20-alpine AS runner

WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Install production dependencies only
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force

# Copy compiled JavaScript output from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist

# Non-root security user
USER node

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]

Automated Verification & CI/CD Pipeline Integration
Use this shell verification script (verify-build.sh) locally or within your CI/CD runner (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI) to validate that the TypeScript configuration error is resolved.
Automated Verification Script: verify-build.sh
